\chapter{Relevance Feedback with Adaptive Sampling}

One of the most important questions we would like to answer is: given an
initial distribution of scores, where should we be sampling from? In this
chapter, we take advantage from the fact that we gradually gain more
information about the score distribution over time to dynamically determine
where we should be sampling from.

First, we perform different statistical analyses on the data. Then we propose a
new sampling scheme based on our analyses. Finally, we set up an experiment to
compare the performance of our proposed scheme to the other standard sampling
policies we have implemented.

\section{Statistical Analysis}

\subsection{Probability of Score given matches/non-matches}

We can estimate the probability of score given a match by
$$\Pr{(score=s \mid match)} = \frac{\texttt{\# matches\_whose\_score=s}}
    {\texttt{\# matches}}$$
In the same way,
$$\Pr{(score=s \mid nonmatch)} = \frac{\texttt{\# nonmatches\_whose\_score=s}}
    {\texttt{\# nonmatches}}$$

  \label{fig:grand_dsm} %chktex 24
\end{figure}

From Figure~\ref{fig:grand_dsm}, we can deduct following conclusions:
\begin{itemize}
\item Most of the cohorts has score between 0 and 0.07 overall so most matches
and non-matches have score less than 0.06.
\item We expected $\Pr{(score \mid match)}$ to increase as the function of score
, but it turns out that it actually decreases. This results from the fact that
there are \emph{very few} matches with scores higher than 0.33, which is the 99th
percentile of the matches' score.
\item The number of matches with $score \in [0.08, 0.35)$ is greater than that of
non-matches with the score in the same range. That is
$$\Pr{(score \mid match)} > \Pr{(score \mid nonmatch)} \mbox{ where } score\in [0.08, 0.35)$$
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Probability of a matching score at a given cohort size}

  \label{fig:grand_psnoncohort} %chktex 24
\end{figure}

Initially, we expected that as the cohort size increases, $\Pr{(score \mid
\#cohort)}$ should peak closer to 1 since $\texttt{selfscore}$ should decrease
and $\max{(\texttt{sift\_match}(I_i, I_j))}$ should increase as the number of
captures in a cohort increases. However, the distribution of $\Pr{(score \mid
\#cohort)}$ for all numbers of cohorts seem to be similar to one another.

\subsection{Earth Mover's Distance}

We use Earth Mover's Distance (EMD)~\cite{emd00} as our metric to calculate the
minimal cost required to transform $\Pr{(score \mid nonmatch)}$ to $\Pr{(score \mid match)}$.

  \caption{Earth Mover's Distance between the probability distributions}
  \label{fig:grand_emd} %chktex 24
\end{figure}

Initially, we also expected that the relationship between EMD and cohort size
should be Gaussian. However, there seem to be no relationship between
$\Pr{(score \mid nonmatch)}$ and $\Pr{(score \mid match)}$.

\subsection{Entropy of $\Pr{(score \mid match)}$ at different cohort sizes}

Entropy is the average amount of information we get from each distribution.
$H(X|Y)$ = amount of randomness in the random variable X given the event Y.

\section{Adaptive Sampling Policies} % (fold)
\label{sec:sampling_policies}

Starting with a completely unknown pairs, we would like to first get the idea
of how the overall distribution looks like. As we have seen in
Chapter~\ref{chap:relevance_feedback}, the unbiased sampling policies, such as
Uniform, and AllScores, that broadly sample the data from the distribution seem
to form a set of good candidates.

Upon the retrieval of the general distribution, we would like to adaptively
utilize the known data to determine the optimal sampling site. We experiment
with sampling from the peak of the difference between the CDF of the score
given matches and non-matches using various sampling policies.

After we get the general picture of the distribution, we repeatedly reconstruct
the plot of the difference between the CDF of the score given matches and
non-matches, then uses normal sampling policy to overlay a Gaussian
distribution, with $\mu=$\texttt{peak\_of\_the\_CDF\_difference} and
$\sigma=0.3$, on the data. We continue each cycle by the sampling probability
distribution reconstruction, and sampling from the generated distribution.
Additionally, we also use Specific sampling policy to sample specifically at the
\texttt{peak\_of\_the\_CDF\_difference} to compare the performance with the
Normal sampling policy.

\section{Results}

\end{figure}

The adaptive sampling policy seem to perform averagely well. The performance
does not differ from that of the other static sampling policies we have seen in
Chapter~\ref{chap:relevance_feedback}.
